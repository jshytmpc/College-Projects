        * (Hypothetical Annual Water Bill Summary Problem )
        * The water bills for the 12 months of a year by a water service
        * subscriber is summarized as follows.
        * <p>
        * Inputs:
        * Water Meter Reading at the beginning of the year (i.e. January 1)
        * Water Meter Readings at the end of each of the 12 months
        * Payment Rates (Minimum Bill, price of water per cubic meter)
        * <p>
        * Outputs:
        * Cubic meters of water consumed for each month (monthly consumption)
        * Amount paid for each month based on given rates (monthly payment)
        * Average of monthly consumptions
        * Average of monthly payments
        * The month during which the amount of water consumed is highest
        * The month during which the amount of water consumed is lowest
        * <p>
        * Algorithm
        * 1.Read the  name of the water consumer (consumer).
        * 2.Read The classification (cType) of the consumer such
        * that the only valid values for cType is "commercial" or "residential".
        * 3.Read water meter reading in cubic meters at the beginning of the year(previousR[0]).
        * 4.For month 1 to 12
        * Read the water meter reading in cubic meters at the end of the month (presentR) such
        * that presentR cannot be less than previousR. Store the value in an array.
        * <p>
        * Compute the volume of water consumed for the month (consumption)
        * by subtracting the previousR from presentR.  Store the value in an array.
        * <p>
        * Compute the amount due (amountDue) from the consumer based on
        * the following rules
        * If cType is residential and consumption  <= 12, the amount due is 180.00
        * If cType is residential and consumption > 12, the amount due is 180.00 + (consumption – 12)*30.00
        * If cType is commercial and consumption <= 30, the amount due is 600.00
        * If cType is commercial and consumption > 30, the amount due is 600.00 + (consumption – 30)*50.00
        * <p>
        * Store the value in an array.
        * <p>
        * 5. Determine the average of the monthly water consumptions.
        * 6. Determine the average of the monthly payments.
        * 7. Determine the month during which water consumed is highest.
        * 8. Determine the month during which water consumed is least.
        * 9. Print the name of the consumer.
        * 10. Print the consumer type.
        * 11. Print the water meter reading at the beginning of the year.
        * 12. Print a table showing the 12 months, water meter readings at
        * the end of each month, the amount paid due to the water
        * consumption for each month.
        * 13. Print the average of the monthly water consumptions.
        * 14. Print the average of the monthly payments.
        * 15. Print the month during which water consumption is highest.
        * 16. Print the month during which water consumption is lowest.
